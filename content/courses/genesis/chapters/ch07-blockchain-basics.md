# Chapter 7: Blockchain Basics

## 7.0 What Is a Block?
A block is a page of transactions plus a hash and link to the previous block.

## 7.1 Why Hashes Matter
Hashes are fingerprints; any change breaks the chain.

## 7.2 Why it’s Called a Chain
Each block points to the previous; rewriting history is infeasible.

## 7.3 Who Adds the Blocks?
Miners bundle transactions and solve Proof-of-Work puzzles to add blocks.

## 7.4 Why Blockchain Matters
History becomes tamper-evident; trust shifts from institutions to math.

### Activity: Build a Human Blockchain
- Students link “blocks” and see tampering break the chain.
