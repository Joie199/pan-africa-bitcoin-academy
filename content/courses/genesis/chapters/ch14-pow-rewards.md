# Chapter 14: Proof of Work and Block Rewards

## 14.0 Proof of Work
- Hard to make, easy to verify; secures Bitcoin.

## 14.1 Miners & Block Rewards
- Current reward: 3.125 BTC (post-Apr 2024) + fees; incentivizes honest mining.

## 14.2 Halving Schedule and Monetary Inflation
- Reward halves ~every 210,000 blocks (~4 years); declining issuance vs fiat CPI.

## 14.3 Subsidy Timeline — 2140 End of New Supply
- Fixed 21M cap; fees eventually sustain miners.

### Activity: “Proof-of-Work by Hand”
- Simulate PoW with puzzles; discuss difficulty and rewards.
