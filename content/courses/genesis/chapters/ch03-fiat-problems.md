# Chapter 3: Problems with Traditional (Fiat) Money

## Introduction
Fiat money is convenient but brings inflation, centralization, exclusion, and fragility.

## 3.1 Inflation and Loss of Purchasing Power
Money buys less over time. Monetary inflation (printing) drives price inflation (CPI).  
Examples: Zimbabwe hyperinflation; steady shilling weakness vs USD.

## 3.2 Centralized Control — Governments and Banks
Printing, rates, and bailouts are decided by few; citizens bear the cost.

## 3.3 Financial Exclusion and Inequality
Many lack bank access; elites get cheaper credit and bailouts.

## 3.4 Fragility of the Current System
Crises, bank runs, and currency collapses recur (2008 bailouts, capital controls).

### Class Discussion: “Do We Trust Our Money?”
- Will your money hold value in 10 years?
- Experiences with rising prices?
- Do banks/governments act in people’s best interest?
- How would you design better money?
