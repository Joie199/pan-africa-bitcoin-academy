# Chapter 8: Exchange & Software Wallet

## 8.0 What Is an Exchange? How to Acquire Bitcoin
- Centralized on-ramp with KYC; start small; withdraw to your own wallet.
- P2P/meetups: add human risk; meet safely.

## 8.1 Software Signer (Mobile/Desktop)
- Wallet generates seed phrase (12/24 words). Write offline; no photos/cloud.
- Practice recovery before using real funds.
- Consider passphrase (25th word) for extra security.

## 8.2 Complete a First Transaction
- Receive: new address/QR each time; avoid reuse.
- Send: verify address, amount unit, fee; test send if unsure.
- Fees depend on vBytes, not amount; higher fee = faster confirm.

## 8.3 Privacy Basics
- Avoid address reuse; be careful with txids/screenshots.
- Prefer local-first/SPV or own node; use VPN on untrusted Wi-Fi.
- Protect accounts: 2FA app (not SMS), strong unique passwords.

### Activity: Testnet Walkthrough
- “Buy” mock sats; send/receive; recover from seed; observe fees and confirmations.
