# Chapter 12: Layer 2 & Sidechains

## 12.0 Lightning Basics
- Fast, low-fee payments via channels; settles net on-chain.  
- Trade-offs: liquidity management; funds final when channel closes.

## 12.1 Receive and Spend via Lightning
- Custodial: convenient but requires trust.  
- Non-custodial: full control, more setup.  

## 12.2 Sidechains Overview
- Pegged chains (e.g., Liquid) with faster/alternative features; trust/ federation trade-offs.

## 12.3 Circular Economies
- Communities running on sats; Lightning/sidechains enable daily commerce.
