# Chapter 13: Verify for Yourself — Block Explorers & Nodes

## 13.0 Using a Block Explorer
- Check txid, confirmations, fee rates; verify funds independently.

## 13.1 Proving Inclusion (Merkle Path, High-Level)
- Merkle path links a tx to the block’s Merkle root; enables lightweight proof.

## 13.2 Why Run a Node (Don’t Trust—Verify)
- Enforce rules yourself; view mempool; avoid trusting third parties.

## 13.3 First-Time Sync & Costs
- Full vs pruned vs lightweight; plan storage/bandwidth; defer advanced setups if needed.

### Activity: Explorer Scavenger Hunt
- Find txids, confirmations, fees; explore mempool; follow Merkle proof conceptually.
