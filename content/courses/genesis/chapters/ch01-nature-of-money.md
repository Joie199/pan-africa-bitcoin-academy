# Chapter 1: The Nature of Money

## Introduction
Imagine waking up in a world without money. You have bananas, but you’re craving bread. You walk to the baker and offer him your bananas. The baker frowns and says, “I don’t want bananas today, I want shoes.” Now you’re stuck. To get bread, you must first find a shoemaker who wants bananas, trade with him, and then go back to the baker with shoes. This back-and-forth feels exhausting and uncertain. This is the “double coincidence of wants.” Both sides must want exactly what the other has, at the same time, in the correct quantity.  

This is why humans invented money. Money became the bridge — a universal tool that allowed people to exchange value without endless searching or awkward swaps.

## 1.1 Why Humans Created Money
In the earliest communities, people survived through barter trade. They exchanged cattle for salt, beads for grain, or iron tools for cloth. But barter was clumsy.  
As villages grew and trade stretched across regions, people needed something that everyone would accept. Societies turned to special items: shells, salt, beads, and eventually precious metals like gold and silver. These worked because they were widely trusted, didn’t rot easily, and could be carried in a pocket. Cowrie shells in Africa and gold/silver coins elsewhere became common money. Later, banks issued paper notes backed by those metals. Over centuries, money evolved — but its purpose stayed the same: make trade easier, faster, and more reliable.

Without money, economies would remain tiny and local. With money, people could build markets, cities, and global trade.

### Activity: Class Questions on “What is Money?”
- If money disappeared tomorrow, how would people in your community trade?
- What item could work as money, and why?
- Is your country’s money a good store of value? Why/why not?
- Why do people still trust paper notes, even though they’re not backed by gold?
- In your words: What is money to you?

## 1.2 Functions of Money — Medium of Exchange, Store of Value, Unit of Account
Money has three core functions:
- **Medium of Exchange**: Removes awkward bartering; sell for money, then buy what you need later.  
- **Store of Value**: Save today, use tomorrow. Inflation erodes this.  
- **Unit of Account**: Standard measure for prices (e.g., 1 goat = 150,000 shillings).  

## 1.3 Properties of Sound Money
Sound money is:
- **Durable** — lasts (gold survives; maize spoils).  
- **Portable** — easy to carry (coins vs cows).  
- **Divisible** — can split into smaller parts (shillings vs a cow).  
- **Recognizable** — easy to verify as real.  
- **Scarce** — hard to create more (gold is rare).  

When money has these qualities, people trust it. Without trust, money collapses and trade falls apart.
