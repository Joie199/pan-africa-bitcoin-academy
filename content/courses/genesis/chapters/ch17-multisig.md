# Chapter 17: Multi-Sig (Collaborative Custody)

## 17.0 Why Multi-Sig (Family/Orgs/Inheritance)
- Multiple signatures reduce single-point risk; good for shared or inherited funds.

## 17.1 M-of-N Designs; Coordinator vs Coordinator-Less
- 2-of-3, etc.; coordinator simplifies UX but adds a trust point; coordinator-less maximizes sovereignty.
- Secure key generation, distribution, and rotation are essential.

## 17.2 Backup Strategies and Operational Playbooks
- Geographic backups, encrypted storage, recovery drills, emergency access, and key rotation plans.

### Activity: Design a 2-of-3 Family Custody Plan
- Define keys, backups, signing flow (PSBT), and emergency procedures.
