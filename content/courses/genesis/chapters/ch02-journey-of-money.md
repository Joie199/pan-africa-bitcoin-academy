# Chapter 2: The Journey of Money

## Introduction
Money evolved from local barter to global trade: commodities, coins, paper, and fiat. Each step answered the question: how can we trade more easily, save safely, and connect farther?

## 2.1 From Barter to Commodity Exchange
Barter was slow and fragile. Communities adopted commodities everyone valued (cowrie shells, salt, cattle) as early money.

## 2.2 Coinage and Precious Metals
Carrying salt or cattle was impractical. Gold and silver were durable, portable, and divisible. Civilizations minted coins; in Africa, Aksum struck coins that traveled long distances.

## 2.3 Paper Money and Banknotes
Carrying many coins was risky. People deposited metals with goldsmiths and used paper receipts that circulated as money. Governments issued banknotes backed by gold. Example: early Chinese “Jiaozi” notes.

## 2.4 The Rise of Fiat Currencies
In 1971, the US ended the gold standard; most currencies became fiat. Fiat = value by decree, enabling flexible supply but risking inflation. Zimbabwe’s hyperinflation and weakening local currencies illustrate the cost.

## 2.5 Precursors to Bitcoin — Haber & Stornetta (1991–92)
Time-stamping for tamper-evidence planted the seed for Bitcoin’s decentralized trust model.
